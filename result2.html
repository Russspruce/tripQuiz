       With casinos, bars, restaurants, and attractions galore.  You have no restrictions
       when it comes to money and fun, so you can go ahead and try to win big, or go out and see
       some of the amazing performances throughout the city.  There is no end in sight in this
     city where the neon lights are shining bright.  Sure there is a bit more of a risk, but you
     will have fun from beginning to end.</p>
